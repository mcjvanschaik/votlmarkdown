Markdownotl - Vim Markdown Outliner~

votl and Vimoutliner are two implementations of comfortable outlining in Vim.
Outlining for writing text helps to create structure, but publishing in
outline format is not practical. There are many conversion scripts available
for outlines, but I like Pandoc for most of my text-to-publish work. 

Markdownotl provides easy conversion from outline-format to markdown, and vice
versa.

Markdownotl uses tab based outlines. This means that the first level has no
indentation and every other level is preceded by tabs. 

Vimoutliner and votl are two Vim plugins that make it easier to create and
change outlines in Vim. Although they are not required to make a tab-based
outline, it is recommended that you install one of these plugins. The settings
and colorscheme are optimized for tab based outlines.

Version 0.1 	initial release 	June 2019

A long time ago I found two functions that were posted as an answer to the
question how to convert to markdown. I found these in a gist with the sidenote
that the original was not known anymore. Brandon Pittman posted the gist.

Requirements~

Vim version 6 introduced folding, which is an essential feature for using
outliners. You can choose Vimoutliner or votl, or even TVO, as long as you are
creating tabbed oulines comfortably.
